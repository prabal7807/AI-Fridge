Using the smart trash binscenario:

*Empathy Map:
•Says: “This bindoesn'taIwayswork."
•Thinks:"Is this technology reliable?"
•Does: Uses traditional bins instead.
•FeeIs: Frustrated with inconsistent performance

*DesignThinkingApproach:
•Empathize: Understand user concerns(sensor failures, unclear indicators).
•Define: Identify pain points(malfunctions,
confusion, slow adoption).
•Ideate: Brainstorm solutions(better sensors,
clear signals, education).
•Prototype: Develop improved bin models with
enhanced reliability.
•Test: Gather user feedback and iterate.
